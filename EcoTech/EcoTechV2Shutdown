Regret to inform all of you, EcoTech V2 and EcoTech itself will be shutting down entirely soon.

For everyone that is active, I give you permission to share any of my leaks I posted as long as you give credit to them. For other leaks, make sure to ask permission via the original posters themselves.

For those that have worked hard giving EcoTech their reputation, your work will be rewarded.

Until then, all you can do is talk to members and wait for mysterious giveaways.

What I advise most of you all to do is to just find another leaking server that requires members and people to support their goals. I don't mind if you won't be inactive anymore, and level 10+ members will be getting HRC Authorization (‚Å†Unknown) regardless of whom they are.

For some of you members, you may think this is an achievement for EcoTech to be shutting down. I myself, believe it will help me go back to what my life was, instead of focusing on this server and maintaining happiness for all.

Thank you all for supporting us, even if you have been inactive,
and no, it will not be shutting down right now, nor tomorrow.

More specifically, thank you to all: (This is in no specific order whatsoever)
